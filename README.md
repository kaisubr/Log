# Log
Inspired by Android's logging mechanism, this program lets you log information in color (if your output window supports it).

```
/**
 * Example usage of the Log class
 */

Log.i("Something happened (use to report general information)");
Log.e("Error (use to report definite errors)");
Log.w("Warning (use to report possible errors)");
Log.d("Debug (use to check flow of program)");
Log.v("Verbose (use to check flow in almost every part of program)");
Log.s("Success (use to report successes)");
Log.n("Expired (use to report messages that are no longer in use)");
```
